## Frequently Questions


<details>
<summary>1. macOS prompts "Polyglot" cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.</summary>

This error is due to the Gatekeeper security feature in the macOS operating system preventing the application from running.
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

Open "System Preferences" and click on "Security & Privacy."
In the "General" tab, you will see a message: "Polyglot" was blocked. Click on "Open Anyway."
Alternatively, you can click "Open Anyways" to open your application.
(Admin permissions may be required to open the application.)

If you don't want to perform these steps every time you open the application, you can add the application to the whitelist to run without being blocked. To add your application to the whitelist, do the following:

Open Terminal and enter the following command:

```sh
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Polyglot.app
```
Here, /path/to/Polyglot.app is the full path to your application.

After running the command, the application will be added to the whitelist, and Gatekeeper will no longer block its execution.
